**Virtual reality** is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world _(called hyperreality)_. Opinions differ on what exactly constitutes a true VR experience, but in general it should include three-dimensional images that appear to be life-sized from the perspective of the user while also having the ability to track a user's motions, particularly his head and eye movements, and correspondingly adjust the images on the user's display to reflect the change in perspective
