## Virtual Reality
**Virtual reality** is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world (called hyperreality). Applications of virtual reality can include entertainment and educational purposes. Other, distinct types of VR style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality. Opinions differ on what exactly constitutes a true VR experience, but in general it should include three-dimensional images that appear to be life-sized from the perspective of the user. While also having the ability to track a user's motions, particularly his head and eye movements, and correspondingly adjust the images on the user's display to reflect the change in perspective
Virtual reality is the creation of a virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we experience it as if we were really there. It uses a host of technologies to achieve this goal for perception and cognition. It has both entertainment and serious uses. The technology is becoming cheaper and more widespread. We can expect to see many more innovative uses for the technology in the future and perhaps a fundamental way in which we communicate and work thanks to the possibilities of virtual reality. 
VR is used in examples such as:
* Architecture
* Sports 
* Health
* Practice Runs
